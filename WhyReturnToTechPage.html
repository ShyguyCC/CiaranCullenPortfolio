							<h2>Why Return To Tech.</h2>
							<p>The reasons that I want to return to tech is that I understand that it’s a growth market that everyone is looking to expand into as it now has someone to do with our everyday lives to going shopping at self service checkouts to entertainment. There is no real way to escape technology but if I can develop someone that becomes a piece in technology where I can say that I did helped made an application that thousands of people use every day I will be very proud of myself.</a></p>
							<p>I also want to develop my programming skills so that one day in the future I will be confident to train or just help the next generation of people who are looking into programming and seeing if it’s the right job for them or not. I want to be able to teach someone with no programming experience how to program if it takes some time as if they are serious enough to try to learn programming, I believe they should also have the opportunity to.</a></p>

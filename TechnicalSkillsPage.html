							<h2>Ciaran Cullens Technical Skills.</h2>
							<p>Over the course of my journey in technology I have been thought mostly about C++ and C# programming.</a></p>
							<p>For C++ I used Visual Studio to develop several games using library’s like SDL for 2D and multiplayer games and OpenGL for 3D game demo. This thought me about how to use librarys to add on the program that I am developing as there maybe a problem that I am faced which is already fixed by using a library.</a></p>
							<p>For C# I first learned the language in the games programming university course. I developed C# Scripts for the game engine Unity. Scripts mostly consisted of moving objects in the game engine and detecting any collision between objects. The games that unity was used for was the mobile and VR games as it makes it easier to develop on those platforms than to try to develop from no engine. While in sparta global I learned about automation testing and how to create them using C#. Here I learned how to use Nunit, Specflow and selenium to create test cases and design tests to make sure that an API or website was not broken. I later in my own time have tried to learn how to use Appium but with limited learning materials I’ve been able to test using a windows calculator but not a mobile website yet.</a></p>
							<p>Currently I am excited to learn about HTML, CSS, Java and Javascript with techreturners and will be open to learning much more technologies as time passes on and as technology develops.</a></p>

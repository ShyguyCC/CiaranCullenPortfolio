							<h2>Ciaran Cullens Transferable skills.</h2>
							<p>Outside of technological work I have learned difference skills that I believe helps me in a tech role although it doesn’t have to explicitly do with technology.</a></p>
							<p>While in university I became a student ambassador to learn to communicate and talk to different people. While working as a student ambassador I learned how to work as a team as small as 2 people working a small booth in an event like UCAS, to working with 15 people together for an opening day to show interested people the courses that the university does. I thought me about planning and how a meeting before a big working session like an open day can really make things go smoother as everyone will be on the same page and know where other departments are in case someone asks a question that someone else will be able to answer.</a></p>
							<p>In Sparta global I learned how to brighten the mood. As it was nearing the end of training the class saw a sudden drop off of people getting jobs with clients with only one person in the class being paired with a client before training was finished. When we started a class of 6 was already accepted by clients. This made the majority of the class a little bit depressed but a friend that I made in Sparta and I made sure to keep things lively with light jokes and making sure that everyone knew that even if we don’t get paired with a client at least we had the training and the ISTQB qualification for when we go independent.</a></p>
							<p>In my own personal life, I have thought my parents and one of my mom’s friends how to use technology as they weren’t brought up with it. In the case of my mother, I had thought her how to log into a computer, how to email, use Facebook and talk to family overseas. For my dad I thought him how to use his phone not just for calling and text, now he can look up anything he wants to buy and get it himself. For my mom’s friend I have helped her with how to get into an interview using Teams and Zoom. I make sure to have lots of patience as technology can be a pretty big concept to handle and if I can I like to write what to do step by step clearly so they can understand. I really like helping people learn about technology as it can help them develop for them self.</a></p>
